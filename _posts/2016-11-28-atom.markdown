When I joined Atom, I was required to build a presence on social media and construct their tone of voice. I also developed a content strategy with the primary aim of raising awareness of Atom and earning pre-registered sign-ups.

The tone of voice was pitched to execs as unprecedented within the UK financial sector. It needed to speak to a broad audience - from early adopting millennials to tech-savvy Mums & Dads. As well as receiving rave reviews it also informed all marketing campaigns and was embedded into the customer service team throughout multiple training sessions which I conducted. Content created included social media posts, emails, blogs, videos, and website copy.
