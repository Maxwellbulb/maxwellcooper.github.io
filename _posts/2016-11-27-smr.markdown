The UK’s biggest tech jobs fair didn’t have a problem filling spaces, but they weren’t quite attracting the right audience. I created content that raised awareness of the event while speaking to a more senior audience. Blogs were built, and advert copy written - alongside supporting creatives - to attract senior jobseekers to the event.

I also ran a B2B cold email campaign, with the objective of convincing established companies to exhibit at the event. These emails focused on the proof points of siliconmilkroundabout and pain points of hiring. The ROI of this campaign was 2000%.
