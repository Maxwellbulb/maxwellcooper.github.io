To raise awareness of their new ‘product search’ feature, we ran a series of promotional ads for Westfield. We utilised a string of different messaging which we then pulled insights from to experiment on homepage copy.

Variants of A/B tests were compiled with different messaging, all focusing on the usage of the search feature.
