During my time at TrueUp, I developed a content strategy with the focus on generating leads. Written content focusing on the importance of testing and website optimisation positioned TrueUp as an idyllic marketing agency. During the time the blog was live, seven leads came in, with five turning to actual work.

In an attempt to increase TrueUpâ€™s presence within the marketing sector, I also wrote and entered two successful award submissions, receiving nominations for the Drum Marketing Awards 2018.
